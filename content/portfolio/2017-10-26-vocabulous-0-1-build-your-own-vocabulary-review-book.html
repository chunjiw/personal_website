<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Exactly 11 months ago, I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://chunjiw.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/how-to-break-vocabulary-bottleneck/"><strong>How to Break Vocabulary Bottleneck</strong></a>, in which I talked about how learning new English words has been a challenge for college graduates. I think there are basically three reasons why it has become a challenge:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are no exams, texts, and deadlines anymore as sources of motivation;</li>
<li>Exposure to new words is not enough for memorization given the nature of a long tail distribution of words;</li>
<li>We are constantly distracted.</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems can be solved one at a time:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Focus on the words we come across in our lives, such that we have a motivation to memorize them;</li>
<li>Expose ourselves to those words regularly;</li>
<li>Set up a good reminder system.</li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out that all these components are available: we just need to connect them together, to somehow record new words, feed them into some reminder app, and we should be OK!</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Here I am proud to present Vocabulous, which helps you collect words that you have looked up before, generate flashcards about them, and remind you to review them according to human memory features. I want to thank my friend Doug Schafer for pointing me to <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> and the name of this project.</p>
<div id="why-vocabulous" class="section level4">
<h4>Why Vocabulous</h4>
<p>If you don’t think learning new words is important, then you really don’t need to read the following. If you do, here’s my pitch:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Vocabulous is a personal vocabulary review book. You have full control over what words are included;</li>
<li>Definitions are from the most authoritative dictionary – Oxford English Dictionary;</li>
<li>The review schedule is optimally tuned to fit human memory features.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this project is far from mature right now; it requires a little of your work to get up and running. Please proceed only if you truly think this is necessary.</p>

<div id="get-the-words" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Get the words</h4>
<ul>
<li>Look up a word by Googling it through the “define” keyword. For example, type “define divest”, Google will give you the definition of “divest”;</li>
<li>Download your searches data via <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">Google Takeout</a>. Only download the product “Searches”, otherwise the file is going to be too big.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="get-the-reminder-app-anki" class="section level4">
<h4>2. Get the reminder app Anki</h4>
<ul>
<li>Go to Anki <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/beta.html">App</a> to install Anki onto your computer. Make sure to install the 2.1 beta.</li>
<li>Go to Anki <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">Web</a> and create a profile.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="get-vocabulous-add-on" class="section level4">
<h4>3. Get Vocabulous add-on</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open Anki on your computer, go to Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Get Add-ons;</li>
<li>Type in 602485415 and click “OK”;</li>
<li>Click “View Files” and open the text file <code>__init__.py</code>;</li>
<li>Edit it such that it points to the directory where you saved your Google searches history;</li>
<li>Close Anki and reopen it;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="generate-flashcards" class="section level4">
<h4>4. Generate flashcards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Go to Tools and click Vocabulous. Please wait patiently. Each word requires about 2 seconds to process, so drink a coffee and then come back;</li>
<li>Install Anki on your phone and sync.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
