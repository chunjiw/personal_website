_R for Data Science_ ([R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) is an excellent book about doing data science with R. Here are some solutions I came up with while reading the book. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


3.6.1.6 "Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs": the last graph
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))
```


5.3.1.1 "How could you use `arrange()` to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use `is.na()`)":
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, !is.na(x), x)
```
